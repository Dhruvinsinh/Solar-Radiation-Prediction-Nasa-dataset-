# Solar-Radiation-Prediction-(NASA DATASET)
This project is for prediction of Radiation with different independent variables.
# Content
The dataset contains such columns as: "wind direction", "wind speed", "humidity" and temperature. The response parameter that is to be predicted is: "Solar_radiation". It contains measurements for the past 4 months and you have to predict the level of solar radiation.

Just imagine that you've got solar energy batteries and you want to know will it be reasonable to use them in future?
# Acknowledgements
Thanks NASA for the dataset.
# Inspiration
Predict the level of solar radiation.
Here are some intersecting dependences that i have figured out:
Humidity & Solarradiation. 2.Temeperature & Solarradiation.
